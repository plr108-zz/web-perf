## Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 4 Website Optimization


##This repository contains my submission for the Website Optimization project of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).  Here are the optimizations I made to meet the [specifications of the project](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd001/l-2735848561/m-2686388535).

#### The PageSpeed Insights score for index.html has been optimized (Score of 94 for Mobile, 96 for Desktop).

Optimizations and changes made:

* Inline CSS resources related to above-the-fold content have been moved to index.html

* Google fonts are loaded using [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader)

* Google Analytics script is loaded asynchronously




* Images have been compressed, and CSS and JavaScript resources have been minified using optimized resources provided by PageSpeed Insights

* The index.html files has been reformatted using [jsbeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/)
